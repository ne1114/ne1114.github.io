I am currently majoring Computer Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology and Electrical Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Sience and Technology (KAIST). 

My lifelong goal is to contribute to agricultural revolution and benefit the human nation both directly and indirectly. There have been multiple revolutions to agriculture throughout history, transition from foraging to farming, invention of engines, Haber-Bosch process, and genetic modification. I believe the next era of agriculture will be driven through integration with sensors/actuators, data analysis and the systems to encompass and optimize the two.

To contribute to such goal, I want to take a career as a researcher on fields that I believe are crucial for agricultural applications. My research interest in high-level lies on sensor networks, embedded systems, distributed systems, and edge computing. Putting emphasis on building optimized systems consisting of sensors, storage, and computation. 

Currently, I am working at Embedded Pervasive Lab (EPL) as undergraduate research assistant under supervision of Dr.Ramachandran Umakishore and his Pd.D. student Enrique Apui Saurez. Participating on project named __Rewind__.

  Hi! My name is Jeonghoon Lee. This blog is to post about my research projects, personal projects, and notes. Welcome!
</p>

I am currently majoring Computer Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology and Electrical Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Sience and Technology (KAIST). 

My lifelong goal is to contribute to agricultural revolution which I believe will be done through integration with sensors/actuators, data analysis, and systems to encompass and optimize the two.



There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Atom](https://atom.io)

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/poole/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mdo).

Thanks for reading!
